        <ul>
            <li>This graph illustrates the change in global surface temperature relative to 1951-1980 average temperatures. Nineteen of the hottest years have occurred since 2000, with the exception of 1998, which was helped by a very strong El Niño. The year 2020 tied with 2016 for the hottest year on record since record-keeping began in 1880 (source: NASA/GISS). This research is broadly consistent with similar constructions prepared by the Climatic Research Unit and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</li> <br><br>
            <li>Greenhouse gases are trapping more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which is causing average temperatures to rise all over the world.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important heat-trapping (greenhouse) gas, which is released through human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels, as well as natural processes such as respiration and volcanic eruptions. The first graph shows atmospheric CO2 levels measured at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, in recent years, with the average seasonal cycle removed. The second graph shows CO2 levels during the last three glacial cycles, as reconstructed from ice cores.</li><br>
                <li>Over the past 171 years, human activities have raised atmospheric concentrations of CO2 by nearly 49% above pre-industrial levels starting in 1850. This is more than what had happened naturally over a 20,000 year period (from the Last Glacial Maximum to 1850, from 185 ppm to 280 ppm).</li>

            <ul>

                <li>Data from NASA's GRACE and GRACE Follow-On satellites show that the land ice sheets in  Antarctica have been losing mass since 2002. The GRACE mission concluded science operations in June 2017.</li><br>
                <li>GRACE Follow-On began data collection in June 2018 and is now continuing the mass change data record for both ice sheets. This data record includes the latest data processing improvements and is continually updated as more data are collected (with a lag of up to two months).</li>

                <li>Global sea levels are rising as a result of human-caused global warming, with recent rates being unprecedented over the past 2,000-plus years.</li><br><br> 
                <li>Sea level rise is caused primarily by two factors related to global warming: the added water from melting ice sheets and glaciers and the expansion of seawater as it warms. The first graph tracks the change in sea level since 1993 as observed by satellites.</li>

                <li>Ninety percent of global warming is occurring in the ocean, causing the water’s internal heat to increase since modern record-keeping began in 1955, as shown in the upper chart.
